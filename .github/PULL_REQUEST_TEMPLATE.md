Hello and thank you for wanting to contribute to the MagicMirrorÂ² project!

**Please make sure that you have followed these 4 rules before submitting your Pull Request:**

> 1. Base your pull requests against the `develop` branch.
> 2. Include these infos in the description:
>
> - Does the pull request solve a **related** issue?
> - If so, can you reference the issue like this `Fixes #<issue_number>`?
> - What does the pull request accomplish? Use a list if needed.
> - If it includes major visual changes please add screenshots.
>
> 3. Please run `npm run lint:prettier` before submitting so that
>    style issues are fixed.
> 4. Don't forget to add an entry about your changes to
>    the CHANGELOG.md file.

**Note**: Sometimes the development moves very fast. It is highly
recommended that you update your branch of `develop` before creating a
pull request to send us your changes. This makes everyone's lives
easier (including yours) and helps us out on the development team.

Thanks again and have a nice day!
