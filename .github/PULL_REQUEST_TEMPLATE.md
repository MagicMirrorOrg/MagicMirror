> Please send your pull requests the develop branch.
> Don't forget to add the change to CHANGELOG.md.

**Note**: Sometimes the development moves very fast. It is highly
recommended that you update your branch of `develop` before creating a
pull request to send us your changes. This makes everyone's lives
easier (including yours) and helps us out on the development team.
Thanks!

- Does the pull request solve a **related** issue?
