# Module: News Feed

The `newsfeed` module is one of the default modules of the MagicMirror².
This module displays news headlines based on an RSS feed. Scrolling through news headlines happens time-based (`updateInterval`), but can also be controlled by sending news feed specific notifications to the module.

For configuration options, please check the [MagicMirror² documentation](https://docs.magicmirror.builders/modules/newsfeed.html).
